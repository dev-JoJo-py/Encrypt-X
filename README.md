# 🔐 EncryptX — Secure, Global Data Encryption & Storage Platform

**EncryptX** is a real-world data encryption and storage platform that allows users to securely encrypt, store, and access their data from anywhere in the world — all through a clean and simple interface.

This project is built to explore scalable backend design, encryption logic, and secure data transmission using modern web technologies.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔒 Text Data Encryption (Custom logic for secure input)
- 🌐 Global Access — Use your encrypted data from any device
- 🧱 Modular MVC Architecture
- 🗃️ MongoDB for Persistent Storage
- 🔐 Privacy-focused by design

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
